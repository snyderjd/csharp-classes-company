# NSS C# Classes - Practice: List employees working at a company

## Setup
mkdir -p ~/workspace/csharp/exercises/classes && cd $_
dotnet new console

Using C# classes, you need to create custom types to represent an Employee and a Company. Then you will create some employees, hire them into the company and then display a simple report showing the employee names and their titles.

## Instructions
1. Create a custom type for Employee. An employee has the following properties.
    First name (string)
    Last name (string)
    Title (string)
    Start date (DateTime)

2. Create a custom type for Company. A company has the following properties.
    Date founded (DateTime)
    Company name (string)
    Employees (List<Employee>)

3. The Company class should also have a ListEmployees() method which outputs the name of each employee to the console.

4. In the Main method of your console application, create a new instance of Company, and three instances of Employee. Then assign the employees to the company.
